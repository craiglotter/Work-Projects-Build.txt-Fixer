Work Projects Build.txt Fixer is a simple application that runs through all the Work Project folders in a specified base folder, checking and reformatting the Build.txt file so that if follows the YYYYMMDD.VV format (e.g. 20071010.01).

To select the Projects folder to check, either click on the browse button or drag and drop the folder straight on to the text box. Note that a Projects base folder follows the form of "Base Project Folder" -> "Example App - 04 November 2004" -> "Build.txt"

To start the operation, simply click on the Begin button. 

The help and about menu options brings up the help and about dialog boxes respectively.

(Note that a backup folder is created each time the application runs an operation.)
