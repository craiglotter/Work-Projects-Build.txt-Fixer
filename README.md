Work Projects Build.txt Fixer
=============================

Work Projects Build.txt Fixer is a simple application that runs through all the Work Project folders in a specified base folder, checking and reformatting the Build.txt file so that if follows the YYYYMMDD.VV format (e.g. 20071010.01).

Missing Build.txt files as well as files that don't appear valid are flagged in a log file.

Note that the existing Build.txt files are all backed up before the process is undertaken.
